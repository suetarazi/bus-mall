        Thank you for volunteering to be part of our focus group. We know you have seen magazines with items for sale on airplanes. Now we want to bring this experience to you on while you ride the bus. <br><br> But first, we need to know what items you are most interested in so we can add them to our catalog. Please click on your favorite image. You will be doing several rounds of this task so we can gather input on what you like best!
